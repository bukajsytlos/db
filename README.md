# FAForever DB project

Contains a dockerfile to run our database in a contained environment, along with tools for managing the database.

## Set your Database up

Install [docker](http://docker.com).

**Make sure your port 3306 is not occupied**. Install and initialize the database:

    ./setup_db.sh

Now your FAF database is up and running and contains some dummy data (from `db-data.sql`)

Currently supported flags for `setup_db.sh`:

    -d         Dump DB schema to container STDOUT.
    -c <file>  Dump DB schema to provided file location. If a directory is provided, the file name will be dump.sql.
    -h         Print script command line options.

## Update your Database

If you have an existing database which you need to update, run:

    docker exec -ti faf-db ./migrate.sh

## Connect to your Database

To get a mysql session where you can execute queries conveniently, execute:

    docker exec -ti faf-db mysql -uroot -pbanana
